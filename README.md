# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This project involves the development of a machine learning model designed to predict individual medical insurance costs based on a range of factors, including prior health conditions, age, and body mass index. The process began with the collection of a dataset comprising personal medical insurance costs alongside respective predictive features. Following this, data preprocessing was performed to clean and standardize the data, and to distinguish between dependent and independent variables. A linear regression model was then applied to predict the cost of medical insurance based on the identified features. In essence, this project embodies the application of machine learning to extrapolate personal medical insurance costs from a range of health and demographic factors.
